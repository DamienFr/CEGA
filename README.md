This repository contains scripts and command lines used to compute the RoHO index of a set of high-quality filtered homoplasies. They were used in the preprint

Homoplasies are mutations that emerged repeatedly and independently. They are good candidates for sites under natural selection. In our study, we used a phylogenetic index to assess whether particular homoplasic mutations increase transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. To do so, we quantified the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. This github repository contains the code used to do so.

The CEGA index is based on the ratio of the number of descendents of sister clades with and without a specific mutation over all independent emergences of a homoplasic allele in a phylogeny. Details of its specific computation and reasoning are available in the Material and Methods section of the paper.

## Inputs
- Homoplasyfinder Consistency Index Report (provided, output file of Homoplasyfinder)
- Annotated tree file (not provided due to copyright issues, output file of Homoplasyfinder)
- A matrix of alleles for each isolates at homoplastic positions
The matrix has the following form :

		Isolate_1	Isolate_2	Isolate_3	Isolate_4
	1912	"ref"	"ref"	"not_ref"	"ref"
	11083	"ref"	"not_ref"	"ref"	"undef"
	23043	"ref"	"ref"	"not_ref"	"ref"


## Outputs
- Outputs several figures, tables and statistics 

## Dependencies
ape R package  
phangorn R package  
reshape2 R package  
ggplot2 R package  
doParallel R package (optional, needed for parallelization)  
foreach R package (optional, needed for parallelization)  

*CEGA.R*

In the filtered phylogeny (tree file), for each filtered node of the phylogeny annotated by HomoplasyFinder as corresponding to an ancestor that acquired a homoplasy, this script counts the number of offsprings having "ref", "not_ref" or "undef" alleles based on the input matrix.
To be considered, an internal node must meet the following criterion :
* No children nodes themselves annotated as carrying the homoplasy.   
* Having at least five descendant tips of each allele    
* An homoplasic position is only considered for CEGA score computation if at least n=5 nodes satisfy the two first criteria.

# Acknowledgements

This study was rendered possible only thanks to the very large number of scientists in originating and submitting labs who have readily made available SARS-CoV-2 assemblies to the research community. They are listed in originating-laboratories.txt and submitting-laboratories.txt files.

A test dataset with no copyright issue will hopefully be provided in a few days in order to get the scripts running
